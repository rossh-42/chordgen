# mellowchord

This project is very experimental and I'm not 100% sure of what it will become.  Here's what works now:
* ChordMap class which generates chord sequences following these charts:  https://www.mugglinworks.com/chordmaps/chartmaps.htm
* Simple command line interface for ChordMap
* Output MIDI files so that generated chord sequences can be played
* Output MIDI messages directly to a MIDI port to play chord sequences

Here's where this might go in the future:
* Melody generator that generates melodies to chord sequences (and vice versa?)
* A series of command line tools to easily chain these operations together
